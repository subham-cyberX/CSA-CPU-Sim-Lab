Simulation of Mano's Basic Computer using **CPU Sim 4.0.11** (Java 8 with JavaFX).
Each practical has its own folder containing the program (where applicable) and the screenshots of its output.

## How to run

1. Install **Java 8 with JavaFX** (for example Azul Zulu JDK FX 8) and download **CPU Sim 4.0.11**.
2. Start CPU Sim (`Cpusim4.bat`).
3. **File → Open machine…** and choose `Practical_01_Create_Machine/BasicComputer.cpu`.
4. **File → Open text…** and choose the `.a` program from the practical's folder.
5. Press **Ctrl+2** (assemble and load), then:
   - **Ctrl+R** to run, or
   - **Ctrl+D** to enter debug mode and use **Step by Instr** / **Step by Micro**.
6. For programs that read input, type a number in the yellow console and press **Enter**.
7. **Example (Practical 3):** open `Practical_03_ADD/P03_ADD.a`, press Ctrl+2, then Ctrl+R, and enter `25` and `17`. The console shows `Output: 42`.

## Notes
- Practical 2 uses the same machine file as Practical 1; its screenshots show the fetch routine executed one microinstruction at a time .
- Register values in the debug traces are shown in **Unsigned Dec**; the RAM pane is shown in **Hex**.
